Brightest
=========
Sometimes you need to show a image with QR code in APP for scanner.
Before that, you need to modify brightness to the max value.
When the smart phone performance is bad, it's slow to start up an APP to show the QR code.
You can just screen capture the QR code when start the APP and click this widget to modify the brightness to MAX value.
And then the QR code can be scanned successfully.
